## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 🔹 Linear Regression
A simple and interpretable regression algorithm that models a linear relationship between input features and the target variable (mileage). It serves as a strong baseline model.

### 🔹 Random Forest Regressor
An ensemble-based learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to enhance prediction accuracy. It is well-suited for capturing non-linear relationships and reducing overfitting.
